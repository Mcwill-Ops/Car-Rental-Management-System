* OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
* Memory Management
* Dynamic Arrays

## 🔍 How to Compile

To compile the project:

```sh
g++ src/Core/*.cpp src/main.cpp -o CarRentalSystem

## ✅ Future Improvements

* Implement smart pointers to avoid manual memory management.
* Add unit tests for better reliability.
* Implement a graphical interface using QT.
* Add file manipulation capabilities for data persistence.
* Add an exception ahndling mechanism.
